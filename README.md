## Ben Sheridan-Edwards

I'm an aspiring Full Stack Engineer looking to work with JavaScript's React framework on the front-end and Golang on the back-end. Currently a student at Makers Academy, I'm completely immersing myself in learning the principles of software development using Ruby and JavaScript to solve problems in clever and efficent ways - through an array of different projects and challenges.

## Skills

Open-minded & Curious
-  I've always strived to expand my mind with knowledge from many different people and sources. I'm a viracous reader and listener of audiobooks, with over 1000 hours listening time on audible. I believe reading widely allows you to build realistic mental models for navigating the world and make more informed decisions about how to approach life. I read books on Technology, Business, Finance, Phychology, Philosophy, and Spirituality.

Self-Motivated & Disciplined
- Since starting bodybuilding when I was 16, I've always believed that the body mirrored the mind in many ways. Having the discipline to eat the right foods, train, and do the right thing for my health has all come from my ability to mentally see the long-term goal and choose the right decisions in the moment that allign with the future I want to create. Since starting my journey, I've gained over 20 pounds of lean muscle mass as a natural athlete, and also have high endurance from HIIT, as well as mobility and flexiblity through my daily practice of Yoga.

Effective Communicator
- For the past 4 years in a recruitment/sales role, I've learned to read social situations, fine tune my emotional intelligence, and communicate in a clear and effective way, while being empathetic and considerate to everyone involved in a discussion. As a natural introvert, being in this type of role has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my life so far, and I now see it as one of my greatest assets. During my time as a recruiter, I've lead teams, trained gradutates to consultant level where they're self-suffient, and played a key role in the development of business strategies and client presentations. All these responsiblities required me to be humble, attentive and strategic in delivering communication at the right time, to the right people, with awareness of the wider content of various situations.
